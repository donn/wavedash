# ðŸ’¨ Wavedash Waveform Viewer (ALPHA)
This is my attempt at a Waveform Viewer.

It's browser-based and uses SVG. This allows for scrolling as smooth as your rendering engine of choice allows and sharp rendering on HiDPI displays without canvas's ridiculous RAM overhead.

This is not stable and not really supported (yet). If you use this, you're coming along to a slow and bumpy ride. :)
